## Objective

You are a data analyst for an advertising technology company called "Advert". The company manages advertiser campaigns and the people responsible for that are the account managers. A need for a new report has emerged from the account managers and you are asked to help with that.

## Context

* Each account manager handles multiple advertising campaigns and the goal of a campaign is to acquire new users for the advertiserâ€™s web digital services.

* We track when user sign-up for a digital services and we call this event conversion.
* The advertiser pays us a fixed amount (called payout) for every campaign conversion.
* The total amount an advertiser pays is called spend.
* Some conversions might be rejected because of fraudulent activity, expired events or any other reason so these conversions should NOT be used in our calculations.
* Some conversions might be duplicates and should NOT be used in our calculations.
